In 2020 it is declared by world health organization as ``Public health emergency of international concerns''. The current situation of Covid-19 and chest related diseases have already gone through radical change with the advancements of image processing tools. There is no effective method which can accurately identify all chest related diseases and tackle the multiple class problems with reliable results., Method: There are many potentially impactful applications of Deep Learning to fighting the Covid-19 from Chest X-Ray/CT Images, however, most are still in their early stages due to lack of data sharing as it continues to inhibit overall progress in a variety of medical research problems. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, this work aims to detect the possibility of COVID-19 in the patient. This work provides a significant contribution in terms of Gan based synthetic data and four different types of deep learning- based models which provided state of the art comparable results., Results: A Deep Neural Network model provides a significant contribution in terms of detecting COVID-19 and provides effective analysis of chest related diseases with respect to age and gender. Our model achieves 89\% accuracy in terms of Gan based synthetic data and four different types of deep learning- based models which provided state of the art comparable results., Conclusion: If the gap in identifying of all viral pneumonias is not filled with effective automation of chest disease detection the healthcare industry may have to bear unfavorable circumstances.},

The results reveal that the classification accuracy achieved with synthetic data is comparable to that attained with original data, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating the limitations imposed by noncooperative SAR data scarcity for ATR. This innovative approach offers a promising solution to craft customized synthetic SAR data, ultimately enhancing ATR performance in remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Heart Transplant Rejection (HTR) is a rare condition that requires early detection to prevent lasting damage to the transplanted heart. Unfortunately, the current HTR grading through biopsy image classification lacks consistency among pathologists. In addition, it is a time-consuming task. In this work, we have developed an automated diagnosis pipeline to streamline the heart transplant histopathology image quantification and classification, in order to provide objectivity for clinical decision support for pathologists. Traditionally, developing an automated image classification requires a substantial amount of labeled data. However, HTR is a rare condition and the dataset is usually unbalanced. For example, the dataset from DNA Based Transplant Rejection (DTRT) comprises 1,509 rejection tile images and 190 times more non-rejection tile images. To address the small data sample challenge in training the classifiers, we developed a novel strategy that used diffusion model to generate synthetic images of rejection. We conducted comprehensive HTR grade classification comparing results using dataset with synthetic rejection tiles versus the dataset without any synthetic rejection tiles. The introduction of synthetic augmentation resulted in an improvement from 0.781 to 0.981 for sensitivity, and an improvement from 0.984 to over 0.998 in AUROC. This study illustrated that synthetic data augmentation is a feasible strategy in developing AI solutions for rare diseases. In the future, we will expand in this direction to benefit more rare disease clinical decision support development.},

B-lymphoblasts are found in large numbers in peripheral blood in malignant cases. Early detection of the cell in bone marrow is essential as the disease progresses rapidly if left untreated. However, automated classification of the cell is challenging, owing to its fine-grained variability with B-lymphoid precursor cells and imbalanced data points. Deep learning algorithms demonstrate potential for such fine-grained classification as well as suffer from the imbalanced class problem. In this paper, we explore different deep learning-based State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches to tackle imbalanced classification problems. Our experiment includes input, GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks), and loss-based methods to mitigate the issue of imbalanced class on the challenging C-NMC and ALLIDB-2 dataset for leukemia detection. We have shown empirical evidence that loss-based methods outperform GAN-based and input-based methods in imbalanced classification scenarios.},

Oriented towards use with medical imaging sets where a localization/segmentation annotation is available, our model can simultaneously also produce artificial annotations. We gauge performance numerically by measuring performance through U-Net trained to detect cells on microscopy images, by taking into account the produced augmented dataset.

Materials and Methods A total of 261 oral leukoplakia lesions with a mean of 5.5~years follow-up were analysed from standard digital photographs. A deep learning pipeline composed by a U-Net based segmentation of the lesion followed by a multi-task CNN classifier was used to predict the malignant transformation and the risk of dysplasia of the lesion. An explainability heatmap is constructed using LIME in order to interpret the decision of the model for each output. Results A Dice coefficient of 0.561 was achieved on the segmentation task. For the prediction of a malignant transformation, the model provided a sensitivity of 1 with a specificity of 0.692. For the prediction of high-risk dysplasia, the model achieved a specificity of 0.740 and a sensitivity of 0.928. Conclusion The proposed model using deep learning can be a helpful tool for predicting the possible malignant evolution of oral leukoplakias.

While achieving remarkable OOD detection performance on small datasets, it is not applicable to IMAGENET-scale datasets due to the difficulty in training cGANs with both input images and labels as conditions.},

  abstract = {Expert microscopic analysis of cells obtained from frequent heart biopsies is vital for early detection of pediatric heart transplant rejection to prevent heart failure. Detection of this rare condition is prone to low levels of expert agreement due to the difficulty of identifying subtle rejection signs within biopsy samples. The rarity of pediatric heart transplant rejection also means that very few gold-standard images are available for developing machine learning models. To solve this urgent clinical challenge, we developed a deep learning model to automatically quantify rejection risk within digital images of biopsied tissue using an explainable synthetic data augmentation approach. We developed this explainable AI framework to illustrate how our progressive and inspirational generative adversarial network models distinguish between normal tissue images and those containing cellular rejection signs. To quantify biopsy-level rejection risk, we first detect local rejection features using a binary image classifier trained with expert-annotated and synthetic examples. We converted these local predictions into a biopsy-wide rejection score via an interpretable histogram-based approach. Our model significantly improves upon prior works with the same dataset with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 98.84\% for the local rejection detection task and 95.56\% for the biopsy-rejection prediction task. A biopsy-level sensitivity of 83.33\% makes our approach suitable for early screening of biopsies to prioritize expert analysis. Our framework provides a solution to rare medical imaging challenges currently limited by small datasets.},

  abstract = {In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been successfully applied to generate the SAR images. However, due to the fact that it is more difficult to generate the images than to distinguish the real or fake, GANs usually suffer from the problems of unstable training and mode collapse. As such, a residual and attention-based generative adversarial network (RAGAN) is proposed for SAR data augmentation. Firstly, the directional bounding box is used as a constraint in the RAGAN to limit the position of ship in the generated SAR image, which can be further set as the annotation of the SAR image for ship detection directly. After that, inspired by the residual and attention learning, a residual and attention block (RABlock) and a transposed RABlock (TRABlock) are designed to improve the generator of the RAGAN, thus preventing the whole model from gradient vanishing and suppressing the effects of speckle noise and background to enhance the quality of the generated SAR images. Experimental results on the HRSID data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our RAGAN model in SAR data augmentation for ship detection.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve excellent computer-assisted diagnosis with sufficient annotated training data. However, most medical imaging datasets are small and fragmented. In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can synthesize realistic/diverse additional training images to fill the data lack in the real image distribution; researchers have improved classification by augmenting data with noise-to-image (e.g., random noise samples to diverse pathological images) or imageto-image GANs (e.g., a benign image to a malignant one). Yet, no research has reported results combining noise-to-image and image-to-image GANs for further performance boost. Therefore, to maximize the DA effect with the GAN combinations, we propose a two-step GAN-based DA that generates and refines brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images with/without tumors separately: (i) Progressive Growing of GANs (PGGANs), multi-stage noise-to-image GAN for high-resolution MR image generation, first generates realistic/diverse 256{\texttimes}256 images; (ii) Multimodal UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation (MUNIT) that combines GANs/Variational AutoEncoders or SimGAN that uses a DA-focused GAN loss, further refines the texture/shape of the PGGAN-generated images similarly to the real ones. We thoroughly investigate CNN-based tumor classification results, also considering the influence of pre-training on ImageNet and discarding weird-looking GAN-generated images. The results show that, when combined with classic DA, our two-step GAN-based DA can significantly outperform the classic DA alone, in tumor detection (i.e., boosting sensitivity 93.67\% to 97.48\%) and also in other medical imaging tasks.},

Data augmentation plays an important role in improving robustness and preventing overfitting in machine learning for many applications such as image classification. In this paper, a novel method for data augmentation is proposed to solve the problem of machine learning with small training datasets. The proposed method can synthesise similar images with rich diversity from only a single original training sample to increase the number of training data by using generative adversarial networks (GANs). It is expected that the synthesised images possess class-informative features, which may be in the validation or testing data but not in the training data due to that the training dataset is small, and thus they can be effective as augmented training data to improve the classification accuracy of DCNNs. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method with a novel GAN framework for image training data augmentation can significantly enhance the classification performance of DCNNs for applications where original training data is limited.},

  abstract = {Computer vision has the potential to accelerate decision support in a variety of medical applications, but a paucity of high-quality, open-source datasets hinders the development of decision support applications for open medical environments (i.e., non-laparoscopic). Synthetic data holds promise as a solution for difficult-to-obtain data, such as images from high stress environments or complicated by privacy concerns associated with medical imagery. Modern applications of synthetic data generation such as digital twins (DT) can create high-fidelity and photo-realistic images the surpass traditional data augmentation practices. Moreover, synthetic data is cost-effective, efficient, and highly scalable after initial creation of the assets and environment. This study presents a framework to synthetically generate annotated images from digital 3-D assets in random perspectives and orientations for use in computer-vision (CV) for open medical applications. Datasets of 1,000 annotated synthetic images and 681 real-world images of six object classes were employed in a transfer learning toolkit for an experiment to determine the feasibility of utilizing synthetic data to train models on CV applications to augment or replace training with real-world data. The experiment tested model performance based on three datasets: 1. Synthetic data only; 2. Real-world data only; 3. Training with synthetic data for evaluation with real-world data. Results showed that training on synthetic data to evaluate real-world data met or exceeded the performance of training on real-world data in four of six classes within the datasets utilized. Results show promise for utilizing synthetic data as an alternative to costly, time consuming, and difficult to obtain data types with many areas for further study, such as more detailed and comprehensive environments and assets as well as methodology for noise injection to improve model performance.},

While the resulting synthetic images appear quite similar to the authentic images on which the low-rank adaptation was performed, we find that neither training the EfficientNetB7 DNN model solely on the synthetic data nor augmentation of the real-world dataset with different proportions (10, 25, 50, and 75 percent) of these data leads to the improvement of the accuracy of the model. The findings of our study suggest that a further exploration of the low-rank adaptation options is needed to fully use the capacity of latent diffusion models for the synthesis of biomedical images.},

However, the limited number of public training data restricts the performance improvement of CNN-based methods. To handle the scarcity of training data, we propose a method that can generate synthetic training data for infrared small target detection. We adopt the generative adversarial network framework where synthetic background images and infrared small targets are generated in two independent processes. In the first stage, we synthesize infrared images by transforming visible images into infrared ones. In the second stage, target masks are implanted on the transformed images. Then, the proposed intensity modulation network synthesizes realistic target objects that can be diversely generated from further image processing. Experimental results on the recent public dataset show that, when we train various detection networks using the dataset composed of both real and synthetic images, detection networks yield better performance than using real data only.},

In the current research, the concept of an automatic parking system using the vehicle license plate or the number plate recognition is discussed. It will improve the process with much less hassle by removing human interaction. It will also lead to advancement in the security of vehicles evading the requirement of a slip or a magnetic card which is used to goes in and out for registering vehicles in a parking place. The researcher uses image processing algorithms to make an entry in the database of the parking automatically. AVNPR (Automatic Vehicle Number Plate Recognition) is used for the identification of the number of plates. Due to noise issues, deep algorithms like CNN (convolutional neural networks), RNN (recurrent neural networks) do not correctly recognize the miss-identification of the numbers in the vehicle plate. This problem is rectified by the authors by using the GAN (Generative adversarial networks) algorithm. GAN helps to create high-resolution images from a single low-resolution image. After applying the GAN, the classification of the vehicle plate is done through CNN. During experimentation, the proposed approach achieves 99.39\% recognition accuracy for a vehicle number plate. Hence, the proposed system is suitable for identifying the numbers in the vehicle number plate automatically. Moreover proposed system compared with existing models, it has been found that it has achieved higher accuracy than the other models.},

  abstract = {Deep learning approaches require enough training samples to perform well, but it is a challenge to collect enough real training data and label them manually. In this letter, we propose a practical framework for automatically generating content-rich synthetic images with ground-truth annotations. By rendering 3-D CAD models, we generate two synthetic aircraft image data sets with wide distribution (Syn N and Syn U). For improving the quality of synthetic images, we propose a multiscale attention module which enhances the Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) in spatial and channel dimensions. Then, we compare the synthetic images before and after translation qualitatively and quantitatively. Experiments on Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) very high resolution (VHR)-10, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, orientation robust object detection in aerial images (UCASAOD), and benchmark for object DetectIon in Optical Remote sensing images (DIOR) data sets demonstrate that synthetic data augmentation can improve the performance of aircraft detection in remote sensing images, especially when real data are insufficient.

  abstract = {The deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state of art performance in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR). However, these networks often provide sub-optimal recognition results in the case of imbalanced SAR data distribution. In this paper, a synthetic minority class data method for improving imbalanced SAR target recognition using the generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed. The minority class SAR data is first over-sampled by optimized data augmentation policies from automatic search method, which enlarge the training set for GAN. The progressive growing of GANs (PGGAN) is then trained on these data and generates high quality and diverse minority class SAR data to alleviate imbalanced data distribution. Experimental results on the designed imbalanced distributed Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset indicate that our method can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of minority class by approximately 11.68\%.},

  abstract = {One of the difficulties in diagnosing patients in the field of psychiatry is the lack of objective biomarker measurements. In general, diagnosis is based on traditional methods relying on behavioral symptoms. Currently, diagnostic approaches predominantly rely on traditional methods grounded in behavioral symptoms. The evolution of neuroimaging techniques has prompted extensive investigations into biological indicators of psychiatric disorders. Among these endeavors, the application of deep learning for classification has demonstrated substantial promise. Through generative models like the generative adversarial network (GAN), deep learning is being investigated more in the field of medical image analysis to address the problems of small data samples and class imbalance. In this study, deep learning is implemented for automatic detection of psychiatric diseases from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used for the diagnosis to categorize brain images into one of the classes: (1) normal, (2) schizophrenia, and (3) bipolar disorder. Image synthesis as data augmentation was performed with GAN. The suggested approach aims to advance the state-of-theart in psychiatric diagnosis and promote additional investigation into the use of brain imaging in diagnostic plans. The findings show that the amount of data and subject variability significantly affect the efficacy of approaches for diagnosing psychiatric disorders. In this study, the data scarcity problem CNN training was not successfully resolved by GANbased augmentation. It is determined that in order to develop a successful automatic psychiatric disease diagnostic system, a sufficient data sample must be collected while taking into account variables like subject variability.},

The analysis is mainly performed by human inspectors manually analyzing the acquired images. A low number of defects in real ultrasonic inspections and legal issues concerning data from such inspections make it difficult to obtain proper results from automatic ultrasonic image (B-scan) analysis. The goal of presented research is to obtain an improvement of the detection results by expanding the training data set with realistic synthetic samples. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning Generative Adversarial Network model for generating realistic ultrasonic B-scans with defects in distinct locations. Furthermore, we show that generated B-scans can be used for synthetic data augmentation, and can improve the performances of deep convolutional neural object detection networks. Our novel method was developed on a dataset with almost 4000 images and more than 6000 annotated defects. When trained only on real data, detector can achieve an average precision of 70\%. By training only on generated data the results increased to 72\%, and by mixing generated and real data we achieve almost 76\% average precision. We believe that synthetic data generation can generalize to other tasks with limited data. It could also be used for training human personnel.},

The result shows that the addition of synthetic data improves the performance of ELM with the accuracy of 90\%. This accuracy is better than the accuracy of ELM using only the original dataset which is 85\%.},

Various proposed automated classification and segmentation methods have been evaluated on a number of data sets. However, as of 2021 most data sets are sparse; they either contain only a small number of pollen classes, images in total or are imbalanced overall. In this work, we explore the possibility of creating synthetic pollen grain images from less than 2,000 images per pollen class via a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). For that purpose, we selected two distinct pollen classes from a state of the art pollen data set and evaluated the data set with and without synthetic data on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The enriched data set performed better overall (+1.4\%) and specifically for the two pollen classes (+2\%). We also drastically reduced the no. of real images and were still able to achieve a score of 60\% to 80\%. The experiments show, that our synthesized pollen images are visually close to real-life pollen grains and can be used to enrich imbalanced data sets as an addition to traditional data augmentation methods.},

  abstract = {Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), aiming to train segmentation models solely using image-level labels, has received significant attention. Existing approaches mainly concentrate on creating high-quality pseudo labels by utilizing existing images and their corresponding image-level labels. However, the quality of pseudo labels degrades significantly when the size of available dataset is limited. Thus, in this paper, we tackle this problem from a different view by introducing a novel approach called GPT-Prompt Controlled Diffusion (GPCD) for data augmentation. This approach enhances the current labeled datasets by augmenting with a variety of images, achieved through controlled diffusion guided by GPT prompts. In this process, the existing images and image-level labels provide the necessary control information, where GPT is employed to enrich the prompts, leading to the generation of diverse backgrounds. Moreover, we integrate data source information as tokens into the Vision Transformer (ViT) framework. These tokens are specifically designed to improve the ability of downstream WSSS framework to recognize the origins of augmented images. Our proposed GPCD approach clearly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. This effect is more obvious when the amount of available data is small, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Our source code will be released.},

The performance of supervised deep-learning-based CD for open-pit mines is often limited by the amount of available data, necessitating data augmentation. Current CD data augmentation methods mainly focus on image-, region-, and instance-level transformations. However, mining area changes occur at a finer sub-instance level, leading to suboptimal performance of existing methods. Therefore, this study proposes a novel data augmentation method named generative adversarial network (GAN)-based sub-instance augmentation (GSIA). This method enables the generation of realistic and diverse CD samples using unchanged data from mining areas to address the issue of data scarcity in open-pit mine CD. GSIA comprises three steps. In the first two steps, GSIA achieves sub-instance-level transformations by sequentially applying GAN-based local editing to the labels and images of the mining areas. In the third step, GSIA constructs a synthetic CD dataset by randomly combining the bitemporal data. The effectiveness of GSIA was evaluated by comparing it with 14 other data augmentation methods on five CD models, and GSIA outperformed all of them. In addition, training solely on synthetic data generated by GSIA achieved an overall accuracy of 97.64\% and an F1 -score of 78.65\%, which were comparable to training with all available real data. Furthermore, GSIA can address the insufficient correlation between the training and test sets in domain adaptation. GSIA plays a significant guiding role in the data augmentation for open-pit mine CD. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZilinCode/GSIA.},

  abstract = {Recently, deep learning methods, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have made a massive breakthrough in computer vision. And a big amount of annotated data is the essential cornerstone to reach this success. However, in the medical domain, it is usually difficult (and sometimes even impossible) to get sufficient data for some specific learning tasks. Consequently, in this work, a novel data augmentation solution, called semi-supervised attention-guided CycleGAN (SSA-CycleGAN) is proposed to resolve this problem. Specifically, a cycle-consistency GANs-based model is first proposed to generate synthetic tumor (resp., normal) images from normal (resp., tumor) images. Then, a semi-supervised attention module is further proposed to enhance the model's capability in learning the important details of the training images, which in turns help the generated synthetic images become more realistic. To verify its effectiveness, experimental studies are conducted on three medical image datasets with limited amounts of MRI images, and the proposed SSA-CycleGAN is applied to generate synthetic tumor and normal MRI images for data augmentation. Experimental results show that i) SSA-CycleGAN can add (resp., remove) tumor lesions on (resp., from) the original normal (resp., tumor) images and generate very realistic synthetic tumor (resp. normal) images; and ii) in the ResNet18-based MRI image classification tasks based on these datasets, data augmentation using SSA-CycleGAN achieves much better classification performances than the classic data augmentation methods.},

  abstract = {Purpose Crystalline retinopathy is characterized by reflective crystal deposits in the macula and is caused by various systemic conditions including hereditary, toxic, and embolic etiologies. Herein, we introduce a novel application of deep learning with a multistage generative adversarial network (GAN) to detect crystalline retinopathy using fundus photography. Methods The dataset comprised major classes (healthy retina, diabetic retinopathy, exudative age-related macular degeneration, and drusen) and a crystalline retinopathy class (minor set). To overcome the limited data on crystalline retinopathy, we proposed a novel multistage GAN framework. The GAN was retrained after CutMix combination by inputting the GAN-generated synthetic data as new inputs to the original training data. After the multistage CycleGAN augmented the data for crystalline retinopathy, we built a deep-learning classifier model for detection. Results Using the multistage CycleGAN facilitated realistic fundus photography synthesis with the characteristic features of retinal crystalline deposits. The proposed method outperformed typical transfer learning, prototypical networks, and knowledge distillation for both multiclass and binary classifications. The final model achieved an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics of 0.962 for internal validation and 0.987 for external validation for the detection of crystalline retinopathy. Conclusion We introduced a deep learning approach for detecting crystalline retinopathy, a potential biomarker of underlying systemic pathological conditions. Our approach enables realistic pathological image synthesis and more accurate prediction of crystalline retinopathy, an essential but minor retinal condition.},

For synthesis we use generative models trained on real neuroimaging data to produce novel taskdependent functional brain images. Analyzed generative models include classic approaches such as the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and modern implicit generative models such as the generative adversarial network (GAN) and the variational autoencoder (VAE). In particular, the proposed GAN and VAE models utilize 3-dimensional convolutions, which enables modeling of high-dimensional brain image tensors with structured spatial correlations. The synthesized datasets are then used to augment classifiers designed to predict cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Our results suggest that the proposed models are able to generate high-quality synthetic brain images which are diverse and task-dependent. Perhaps most importantly, the performance improvements of data augmentation via synthesis are shown to be complementary to the choice of the predictive model. Thus, our results suggest that data augmentation via synthesis is a promising approach to address the limited availability of fMRI data, and to improve the quality of predictive fMRI models.},

However, existing FR methods require a large amount of data to train, and their performance can be degraded by factors such as bulletproof helmets worn by soldiers. This paper proposes a new FR method for soldiers with bulletproof helmets that uses generative networks and data augmentation techniques to effectively increase the amount of training data. The proposed method first generates synthetic face images of soldiers with bulletproof helmets using a generative network. Then, it uses data augmentation techniques to further increase the diversity of the training data. The proposed method is evaluated on both our own dataset of soldiers with bulletproof helmets and a public dataset. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing FR methods on both datasets, especially in the presence of bulletproof helmets. Overall, the proposed method is a promising new approach for FR for soldiers with bulletproof helmets. It can be used to improve the performance of FR systems in military applications, such as soldier identification and authentication.},

B-lymphoblasts are found in large numbers in peripheral blood in malignant cases. Early detection of the cell in bone marrow is essential as the disease progresses rapidly if left untreated. However, automated classification of the cell is challenging, owing to its fine-grained variability with B-lymphoid precursor cells and imbalanced data points. Deep learning algorithms demonstrate potential for such fine-grained classification as well as suffer from the imbalanced class problem. In this paper, we explore different deep learning-based State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches to tackle imbalanced classification problems. Our experiment includes input, GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks), and loss-based methods to mitigate the issue of imbalanced class on the challenging C-NMC and ALLIDB-2 dataset for leukemia detection. We have shown empirical evidence that loss-based methods outperform GAN-based and input-based methods in imbalanced classification scenarios.},

  abstract = {Mammography is the primary procedure for breast cancer screening, attempting to reduce breast cancer mortality risk with early detection. Deep learning methods have shown strong applicability to various medical images datasets. Due to paucity of available labeled medical images, accurate computer assisted diagnosis requires intensive data augmentation (DA) techniques, such as geometric/intensity transformations of original images. This data when used along with the training data helps to address the limited medical image dataset collected from various sources. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is one of the DA techniques. GAN trained on images can generate new images that contain many authentic characteristics and look realistic to human observers. Therefore, this paper focuses on overcoming the problem of limited labeled dataset, using Deep Convolution GANs (DCGANs). To analyze the closeness between the original and synthetic images, a visualization tool ImageJ was used. In order to validate the proposed model, a visual Turing test was conducted with the help of medical experts.},

  abstract = {Protecting personal data against exploitation of machine learning models is crucial. Recently, availability attacks have shown great promise to provide an extra layer of protection against the unauthorized use of data to train neural networks. These methods aim to add imperceptible noise to clean data so that the neural networks cannot extract meaningful patterns from the protected data, claiming that they can make personal data "unexploitable." This paper provides a strong countermeasure against such approaches, showing that unexploitable data might only be an illusion. In particular, we leverage the power of diffusion models and show that a carefully designed denoising process can counteract the effectiveness of the data-protecting perturbations. We rigorously analyze our algorithm, and theoretically prove that the amount of required denoising is directly related to the magnitude of the data-protecting perturbations. Our approach, called AVATAR, delivers state-of-the-art performance against a suite of recent availability attacks in various scenarios, outperforming adversarial training even under distribution mismatch between the diffusion model and the protected data. Our findings call for more research into making personal data unexploitable, showing that this goal is far from over. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/hmdolatabadi/AVATAR.},

We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.},

Compared with the conventional methods of data augmentation, the new generated data are more realistic when using the LSGANs to expand the data set, and the recognition accuracy is significantly improved. Transfer learning can apply characteristics extracted from the source domain for the target domain, which effectively reduce the need for training samples in existing algorithms. Features were extracted by using ResNet50 that has been pre-trained, and convolution neural network (CNN) was used as a classifier for SAR target recognition.

However, the required manual inspection can take up to 50~\% of the manufacturing time. The automated classification of fibre layup defects with Neural Networks potentially increases the inspection efficiency. However, the machine decision-making processes of such classifiers are difficult to verify. Hence, we present an approach for analysing the classification procedure of fibre layup defects. Therefore, we comprehensively evaluate 20 Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods from the literature. Accordingly, the techniques Smoothed Integrated Gradients, Guided Gradient Class Activation Mapping and DeepSHAP are applied to a Convolutional Neural Network classifier. These methods analyse the neural activations and robustness of a classifier for an unknown and manipulated input data. Our investigations show that especially Smoothed Integrated Gradients and DeepSHAP are well suited for the visualisation of such classifications. Additionally, maximum-sensitivity and infidelity calculations confirm this behaviour. In future, customers and developers could apply the presented methods for the certification of their inspection systems.},

Recently, these state-of-the-art methods have been applied to estimate image transformations by an unsupervised learning approach. In this letter, a novel spectral index generative adversarial network (SIGAN) is proposed for the generation of multispectral (MS) remote sensing images. This network is defined to effectively perform data augmentation starting from a limited number of training samples in the MS remote sensing domain for training deep learning models. The SIGAN model is able to capture class-specific properties in data augmentation, by incorporating the task-specific normalized spectral indices to model class-by-class properties of MS images. Experimental results obtained on a Sentinel 2 dataset show that the proposed model provides better performance than other generative adversarial networks (GANs) in MS data generation.},

  abstract = {Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is a common yet destructive mental disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Making early and accurate diagnosis of it is very meaningful. Recently, EEG, a non-invasive technique of recording spontaneous electrical activity of brains, has been widely used for MDD diagnosis. However, there are still some challenges in data quality and data size of EEG: (1) A large amount of noise is inevitable during EEG collection, making it difficult to extract discriminative features from raw EEG; (2) It is difficult to recruit a large number of subjects to collect sufficient and diverse data for model training. Both of the challenges cause the overfitting problem, especially for deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose DiffMDD, a diffusion-based deep learning framework for MDD diagnosis using EEG. Specifically, we extract more noise-irrelevant features to improve the model's robustness by designing the Forward Diffusion Noisy Training Module. Then we increase the size and diversity of data to help the model learn more generalized features by designing the Reverse Diffusion Data Augmentation Module. Finally, we re-train the classifier on the augmented dataset for MDD diagnosis. We conducted comprehensive experiments to test the overall performance and each module's effectiveness. The framework was validated on two public MDD diagnosis datasets, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.},

Existing methods primarily focus on generating high-quality pseudo labels using available images and their image-level labels. However, the quality of pseudo labels degrades significantly when the size of available dataset is limited. Thus, in this paper, we tackle this problem from a different view by introducing a novel approach called Image Augmentation with Controlled Diffusion (IACD). This framework effectively augments existing labeled datasets by generating diverse images through controlled diffusion, where the available images and image-level labels are served as the controlling information. Moreover, we also propose a high-quality image selection strategy to mitigate the potential noise introduced by the randomness of diffusion models. In the experiments, our proposed IACD approach clearly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. This effect is more obvious when the amount of available data is small, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract = {Purpose Crystalline retinopathy is characterized by reflective crystal deposits in the macula and is caused by various systemic conditions including hereditary, toxic, and embolic etiologies. Herein, we introduce a novel application of deep learning with a multistage generative adversarial network (GAN) to detect crystalline retinopathy using fundus photography. Methods The dataset comprised major classes (healthy retina, diabetic retinopathy, exudative age-related macular degeneration, and drusen) and a crystalline retinopathy class (minor set). To overcome the limited data on crystalline retinopathy, we proposed a novel multistage GAN framework. The GAN was retrained after CutMix combination by inputting the GAN-generated synthetic data as new inputs to the original training data. After the multistage CycleGAN augmented the data for crystalline retinopathy, we built a deep-learning classifier model for detection. Results Using the multistage CycleGAN facilitated realistic fundus photography synthesis with the characteristic features of retinal crystalline deposits. The proposed method outperformed typical transfer learning, prototypical networks, and knowledge distillation for both multiclass and binary classifications. The final model achieved an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics of 0.962 for internal validation and 0.987 for external validation for the detection of crystalline retinopathy. Conclusion We introduced a deep learning approach for detecting crystalline retinopathy, a potential biomarker of underlying systemic pathological conditions. Our approach enables realistic pathological image synthesis and more accurate prediction of crystalline retinopathy, an essential but minor retinal condition.},

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

However, such models are difficult to interpret, susceptible to overfit, and hard to decode failure. An increasing body of literature, such as class activation map (CAM), focused on understanding what representations or features a model learned from the data. This paper presents novel Eigen-CAM to enhance explanations of CNN predictions by visualizing principal components of learned representations from convolutional layers. The Eigen-CAM is intuitive, easy to use, computationally efficient, and does not require correct classification by the model. Eigen-CAM can work with all CNN models without the need to modify layers or retrain models. For the task of generating a visual explanation of CNN predictions, compared to state-of-the-art methods, Eigen-CAM is more consistent, class discriminative, and robust against classification errors made by dense layers. Empirical analyses and comparison with the best state-of-the-art methods show up to 12\% improvement in weakly-supervised object localization, an average of 13\% improvement in weakly-supervised segmentation, and at least 15\% improvement in generic object proposal.},

However, deep models are perceived as "black box" methods considering the lack of understanding of their internal functioning. There has been a significant recent interest to develop explainable deep learning models, and this paper is an effort in this direction. Building on a recently proposed method called Grad-CAM, we propose Grad-CAM++ to provide better visual explanations of CNN model predictions (when compared to Grad-CAM), in terms of better localization of objects as well as explaining occurrences of multiple objects of a class in a single image. We provide a mathematical explanation for the proposed method, Grad-CAM++, which uses a weighted combination of the positive partial derivatives of the last convolutional layer feature maps with respect to a specific class score as weights to generate a visual explanation for the class label under consideration. Our extensive experiments and evaluations, both subjective and objective, on standard datasets showed that Grad-CAM++ indeed provides better visual explanations for a given CNN architecture when compared to Grad-CAM.},

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

  abstract = {We propose a technique for producing `visual explanations' for decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say logits for `dog' or even a caption), flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad- CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g. visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (d) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a `stronger' deep network from a `weaker' one even when both make identical predictions. Our code is available at https: //github.com/ramprs/grad-cam/ along with a demo on CloudCV [2] and video at youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.},

  abstract = {Synthetic data consists of artificially generated data. When data are scarce, or of poor quality, synthetic data can be used, for example, to improve the performance of machine learning models. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a state-of-the-art deep generative models that can generate novel synthetic samples that follow the underlying data distribution of the original dataset. Reviews on synthetic data generation and on GANs have already been written. However, none in the relevant literature, to the best of our knowledge, has explicitly combined these two topics. This survey aims to fill this gap and provide useful material to new researchers in this field. That is, we aim to provide a survey that combines synthetic data generation and GANs, and that can act as a good and strong starting point for new researchers in the field, so that they have a general overview of the key contributions and useful references. We have conducted a review of the state-of-the-art by querying four major databases: Web of Sciences (WoS), Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. This allowed us to gain insights into the most relevant authors, the most relevant scientific journals in the area, the most cited papers, the most significant research areas, the most important institutions, and the most relevant GAN architectures. GANs were thoroughly reviewed, as well as their most common training problems, their most important breakthroughs, and a focus on GAN architectures for tabular data. Further, the main algorithms for generating synthetic data, their applications and our thoughts on these methods are also expressed. Finally, we reviewed the main techniques for evaluating the quality of synthetic data (especially tabular data) and provided a schematic overview of the information presented in this paper.},

Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models naturally admit a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a generalization of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional {CIFAR}10 dataset, we obtain an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art {FID} score of 3.17. On 256x256 {LSUN}, we obtain sample quality similar to {ProgressiveGAN}.},
